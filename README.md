**DualMap** is an online open-vocabulary mapping system that enables robots to understand and navigate dynamic 3D environments using natural language.

The system supports multiple input sources, including offline datasets (**Dataset Mode**), ROS streams & rosbag files (**ROS Mode**), and iPhone video streams (**Record3d Mode**). We provide examples for each input type.

## News

**[2025.08]**  Full code released! 🎉 Welcome to use, share feedback, and contribute.

## Installation

> ✅ Tested on **Ubuntu 22.04** with **ROS 2 Humble** and **Python 3.10**

### 1. Clone the Repository (with submodules)

```bash
git clone --branch main --single-branch --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Eku127/DualMap.git
cd DualMap
```
>  Make sure to use `--recurse-submodules` to get `mobileclip`.

### 2. Create Conda Environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dualmap


# for my situation
conda install openssl=3.0.13  # Ubuntu 22.04 常用版本
conda install libcurl
```

### 3. Install MobileCLIP
```bash
cd 3rdparty/mobileclip
pip install -e . --no-deps
cd ../..
```
> The system currently defaults to `MobileCLIP-v1`, and all reported results are based on `v1`.
> Since August 2025, `MobileCLIP-v2` has been released, and the system also supports `v2`. You can set up the `v2` environment by following the instructions in [Apple’s MobileCLIP repository](https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip).

### 4. (Optional) Setup ROS 2 Environment
Setting up ROS2 environment for ROS support and applications.
We recommend [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).
Once installed, activate the environment:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

> DualMap’s navigation functionality and real-world integration are based on ROS 2. **Installation is strongly recommended**.

> **ROS1 noetic** is also supported, you can setup the ROS 1 in Ubuntu 22.04 by follow [this guide](resources/doc/ros_communication.md).

### 5. (Optional) Setup Habitat Data Collector

[Habitat Data Collector](https://github.com/Eku127/habitat-data-collector) is a tool built on top of the [Habitat-sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim). It supports agent control, object manipulation, dataset and ROS2 bag recording, as well as navigation through external ROS2 topics. DualMap subscribes to live ROS2 topics from the collector for real-time mapping and language-guided querying, and publishes navigation trajectories for the agent to follow.

> For the best DualMap experience (especially interactive mapping and navigation), **we strongly recommend setting up the Habitat Data Collector**. See [the repo](https://github.com/Eku127/habitat-data-collector) for installation and usage details.


## Applications

Here's a quick overview of the requirements for each application type:

| Application | Conda Env | ROS1 | ROS2 | Habitat Data Collector |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Datasets / Query / iPhone | ✓ | | | |
| ROS (Offline/Online) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Online Sim (Mapping+Nav) | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ |
* **ROS**: Please install either ROS1 or ROS2 based on your needs.
* **Habitat Data Collector**: Currently, it only supports ROS2.

### 💾 Run with Datasets

DualMap supports running with **offline datasets**. Currently supported datasets include:
1. Replica Dataset  
2. ScanNet Dataset  
3. TUM RGB-D Dataset  
4. Self-collected data using [Habitat Data Collector](https://github.com/Eku127/habitat-data-collector)  

For data collected from your own platform, you can organize it in a similar format to run the system.  

Follow the [Dataset Runner Guide](resources/doc/app_runner_dataset.md) to arrange datasets, run DualMap with these datasets and reproduce our offline mapping results in **Table II** in our paper.

### 🤖 Run with ROS

DualMap supports input from both **ROS1** and **ROS2**. You can run the system with **offline rosbags** or in **online mode** with real robots.

Follow the [ROS Runner Guide](resources/doc/app_runner_ros.md) to get started with running DualMap using ROS1/ROS2 rosbags or live ROS streams.

### 🕹️ Online Mapping and Navigation in Simulation

DualMap supports **online** interactive mapping and object navigation in simulation via the [Habitat Data Collector](https://github.com/Eku127/habitat-data-collector).

Follow the [Online Mapping and Navigation Guide](resources/doc/app_simulation.md) to get started with running DualMap in interactive simulation scenes and to reproduce the navigation results (both static and dynamic) in **Table III** in our paper.

### 📱 Run with iPhone

DualMap supports **real-time data streaming** from the **Record3D** app on iPhone.

Follow the [iPhone Runner Guide](resources/doc/app_runner_record_3d.md) to get started with setting up Record3D, streaming data to DualMap, and mapping with your own iPhone!

### 🔍 Offline Map Query

We provide two prebuilt map examples for offline querying: one from iPhone data and one from Replica Room 0.

Follow the [Offline Query Guide](resources/doc/app_offline_query.md) to run the query application.

### 🖼️ Visualization
<p align="center">
    <img src="resources/image/app_visual.jpg" width="100%">
</p>

The system supports both [Rerun](https://rerun.io) and [Rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) visualization. When running with ROS, you can switch the visualizaiton via `use_rerun` and `use_rviz` option in `config/runner_ros.yaml`
